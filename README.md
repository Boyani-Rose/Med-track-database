# Medication Tracker App

## Description
The **Medication Tracker App** is a command-line interface (CLI) application that helps users manage and track their medications based on prescriptions provided by healthcare professionals. It enables users to monitor medication status, log doses taken, and receive reminders based on frequency and prescription duration.

This project was developed as part of a Phase 3 software engineering curriculum to demonstrate knowledge of Python, SQLAlchemy ORM, and relational database design.
